This document explains the rules for playing DZ Box Pi, a fun box-claiming game where you can earn rewards. Here's what you need to know in plain terms:

1. By playing, you agree to these rules.
2. It's a strategy game where you connect dots to claim boxes and compete with others.
3. Please play fair - no cheating, be nice to others, and use only one account.
4. The game works with Pi Network, so their rules apply too.
5. We might change game rules sometimes to keep things fair.
6. Any rewards you earn only have value within the game and Pi Network.
7. Sometimes the game might be down for updates or fixes.
8. We're not responsible if something goes wrong with your game progress or rewards.
9. We can remove players who break these rules.
10. These rules might change, and we'll let you know if they do.
11. If you have questions, contact us through the game or Pi Network.
